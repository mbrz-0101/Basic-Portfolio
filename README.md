# Basic-Portfolio
This portfolio was my first real attempt at a front-end website. It has 3 pages, is very basically responsive, and includes no javascript or functionality outside of HTML and CSS. It includes a personal statement, a link to my first project, and room for more.

This portfolio was quickly replaced by my second and third versions (also included here), called Bootstrap-Portfolio and Responsive-Portfolio.
